/// Dumps the two reaction networks the chemistry stage builds to a plain
/// text file, read directly from the live Geant4 objects at call time:
/// the shared G4DNAMolecularReactionTable singleton (bimolecular pure
/// water + O2 network), and each molecule's ScavengerReactionAccess
/// process instance (per-molecule acid-base/bulk scavenger network).
/// Portable utility, no project-specific state -- copy-paste portable
/// like PureWaterReactions.cc.
