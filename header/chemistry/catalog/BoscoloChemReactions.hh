/// \brief BoscoloChem Chemistry: reaction-table and bulk-reaction list builders
///
/// Reproduces Table 1 of Boscolo et al., "Impact of Target Oxygenation on the
/// Chemical Track Evolution of Ion and Electron Radiation", Int. J. Mol. Sci.
/// 2020, 21, 424: reactions (i)-(xxvi) with the table's rate constants, H2O
/// reactants/products dropped (water is not tracked).
///
/// Self-contained, project-agnostic unit: no DnaChemistryWorld, DnaLogger, or
/// other dnachem-min-specific includes -- only standard Geant4/Geant4-DNA
/// headers. Copy-paste portable to another Geant4-DNA project.
///
/// The paper treats dissolved O2 as a continuum while (xvi), (xvii), (xxv) and
/// (xxvi) produce O2, so (xiv) e_aq + O2 and (xv) H + O2 appear twice: in the
/// reaction table (against *tracked* radiolytic O2) and in the bulk-reaction
/// list (against the dissolved-O2 background set by /chem/env/scavenger O2),
/// with the same rates. The bulk-reaction list holds nothing else.
///
/// No acid-base buffer, by design: the paper has no bulk H3Op(B)/OHm(B)
/// equilibria (see docs/adr/0002-named-chemistries.md), so /chem/env/pH has no
/// chemical effect under this Chemistry. O- and O3- stay in the shared
/// molecule set but take part in no reaction. The paper's Table 2 diffusion
/// coefficients are not applied: molecules are shared by all Chemistries.
/// Needs ChemistryTypes.hh -- copy both files to port this unit.
///
/// Reaction types (IRT_syn): every tracked pair that G4EmDNAChemistry_option3
/// lists as Type II or Type IV calls SetReactionType(1) unconditionally
/// (partially diffusion-controlled); the others stay type 0 (fully
/// diffusion-controlled). The bulk-reaction list keeps its own types (the
/// acid-base equilibria 6/7/8). The driver also adds every bulk reaction to
/// the reaction table, for the mesoscopic stage; a bulk reaction whose pair
/// is already in the table (e.g. e_aq + O2, tracked and bulk O2 share one
/// configuration) must have the same rate and products and shares that entry.
