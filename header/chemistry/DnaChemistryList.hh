/// \file DnaChemistryList.hh
/// \brief Definition of the DnaChemistryList class
///
/// Project chemical stage, replacing the macro-driven `/chem/species` +
/// `/chem/reaction/add` blocks. Inherits BOTH `G4VUserChemistryList`
/// (molecules / reactions / time-step model) and `G4VPhysicsConstructor`
/// (driven directly by PhysicsList, UHDR-style).
///
/// Reaction content: the Chemistry chosen with `/chem/select <name>` before
/// `/run/initialize` (default `PureWater`; see ChemistryRegistry). It supplies
/// the ordinary reaction table and the bulk-reaction list (reactions against
/// bulk species: the pH-driven acid-base buffer against H3Op(B)/OHm(B), UHDR:
/// ChemPureWaterBuilder), registered as per-molecule `G4DNAScavengerProcess`
/// for the particle-based stage and added to the reaction table for the
/// mesoscopic stage.
/// `PureWater` is the portable pure-water + O2-derived network
/// (PureWaterReactions.cc) with the full acid-base network; another Chemistry
/// may omit that buffer
/// (docs/adr/0002-named-chemistries.md).
/// Exogenous scavengers (e.g. dissolved O2, `/chem/env/scavenger` on
/// DnaChemistryWorld) react through the Chemistry's bulk reactions
/// (docs/adr/0004-scavenger-reactions-per-chemistry.md).
///
/// Time-step model: IRT_syn only (hard-coded; SBS and IRT are not supported,
/// any other /process/chem/TimeStepModel value is fatal). The particle-based
/// stage hands over to the mesoscopic stage in TimeStepAction.
