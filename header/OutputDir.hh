/// \brief Process-wide output directory, set once from main() before any
/// worker thread is created.
///
/// Pure: no logging, no process exit. Configure(dir, err) sets the
/// process-wide output directory to dir, creating it if non-empty (its
/// parent must already exist); Resolve() joins that directory onto a
/// filename, or returns the filename unchanged if the configured directory
/// is empty (including before Configure() is ever called). Not
/// thread-synchronized -- callers must call Configure() before spawning any
/// worker thread that calls Resolve(). SetPrefix()/Resolve() also apply an
/// independent filename prefix (prepended before the directory join),
/// separate from the configured directory.
