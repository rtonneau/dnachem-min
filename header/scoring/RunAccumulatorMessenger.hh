/** \file RunAccumulatorMessenger.hh
    UI command to flush the accumulated species/reaction/interaction/energy
    data to disk and reset the underlying counters, from a macro file:
    /run/dumpDataAndReset [prefix]

    Idle-state only (issue it between /run/beamOn calls). prefix (optional,
    default "") is prepended literally (no separator inserted) to every
    output filename written by this flush. Reusing a prefix already used
    earlier in this process is a fatal error -- see
    RunAccumulator::TryReservePrefix.

    /run/dumpDataAndResetToDir <subdir> is the same flush, but writes the
    (unprefixed) files into <subdir> under the output directory instead --
    created if missing, relative and without "..", unique per process (see
    OutputDir::ConfigureSubdir, RunAccumulator::TryReserveSubdir).

    Also exposes FlushIfPending(), called once from sim.cc right before the
    run manager is destroyed, as a safety net so data accumulated but never
    manually flushed isn't silently lost.
