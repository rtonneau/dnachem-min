/// \file RunManifest.hh
/// \brief Geant4-facing collector that writes a dump's Manifest.json.
///
/// The one place that lists the manifest's entries: RecordRun builds each
/// run's entry, Write builds the top-level tree from the live process
/// (selected Chemistry, environment, run manager, output directory,
/// RunAccumulator's totals and run entries). Both use the portable,
/// format-neutral DataNode tree, serialised by the generic JsonWriter --
/// adding or removing an entry is one Add() line here. Write is called once
/// per dump from RunAccumulatorMessenger::WriteAllAndReset, after the data
/// files are written and before the accumulators are cleared.
